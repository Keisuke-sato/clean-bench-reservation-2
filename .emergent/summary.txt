<analysis>
The trajectory details an extensive effort to build and then stabilize a FastAPI/React/MongoDB clean bench reservation system, particularly focusing on Vercel deployment issues. Initially, the AI engineer successfully implemented core features and transitioned the UI. The bulk of the work revolved around persistent  and  errors on Vercel. This involved iterative debugging of  configurations (from  to , static file handling), Python serverless function exports ( handler variations), and environment variable configurations. Critical issues identified included a conflicting root , incorrect API routing (double prefix), and most recently, the Python serverless function not building due to an incorrect Mangum handler assignment. MongoDB connection issues were also investigated and ruled out. The process involved multiple  calls and analysis of external AI feedback (ChatGPT).

<product_requirements>
The user requested an online clean bench reservation system for laboratory members. The primary goal is to manage two distinct benches (手前 - front, 奥 - back) with minute-level reservation granularity and user name association. The UI must be entirely in Japanese. Key functionalities include full CRUD operations for reservations, robust double-booking prevention, and an intuitive daily timetable view with day-switching. Optional enhancements like weekly view, CSV export, and authentication were mentioned but not prioritized. The application must handle Japan Standard Time (UTC+9) correctly.

So far, the application has implemented: two benches with Japanese names, minute-level and 30-minute increment reservation support (7:00-22:00), user name input, full Japanese UI with a timetable grid, double-booking prevention, JST timezone handling, MongoDB Atlas for persistence, enhanced loading error handling with retries, and a feature for deleting old reservation data. Recently, explicit reservation rules were added to the frontend UI.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **FastAPI**: Python web framework for backend APIs.
- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for data storage (MongoDB Atlas in cloud).
- **pytz, python-dateutil**: Python libraries for JST timezone handling.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **Vercel**: Deployment platform for static sites and serverless functions.
- **Mangum**: ASGI adapter for deploying ASGI applications (like FastAPI) on AWS Lambda and other serverless platforms (used by Vercel).
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application utilizes a monorepo structure, but was adapted to Vercel's preferred serverless deployment patterns.



-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: This is the main FastAPI application file for Vercel deployment, handling all backend logic, API endpoints, and MongoDB interactions. It's the serverless function entry point.
    -   **Changes**: Originally , it was moved to  to conform to Vercel's serverless function directory conventions. The  prefix was removed to avoid double-prefixing. The  handler export was repeatedly adjusted ( vs.  vs. ), with the latest instruction suggesting  for proper Vercel detection. Logging configuration was also moved to the top.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: The main React component, rendering the UI and handling frontend logic/API calls.
    -   **Changes**: Transitioned from list to timetable view. Implemented 30-minute intervals (7:00-22:00). Enhanced error handling, added refresh and clean data buttons. Refactored API calls to use a consistent  instance. Added prominent reservation rules section to the UI.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Contains CSS styles for the React frontend, complementing Tailwind.
    -   **Changes**: Adjusted styles for timetable layout and new UI elements. Recently added specific styles for the reservation rules section (blue border, light grey background).

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Lists Python dependencies for the FastAPI backend used by Vercel.
    -   **Changes**: Added  and other necessary libraries like , .

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Manages Node.js dependencies and scripts for the React frontend.
    -   **Changes**: Adjusted React and  versions for stability. Resolved Babel plugin issues.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Configuration for Vercel deployment, crucial for routing.
    -   **Changes**: Heavily iterated. Simplified  to correctly build both frontend (using ) and backend (using ). Changed  to  to support SPA fallback ( to ) and correct API routing ( to ). Adjusted static asset paths to be handled correctly.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: The original main FastAPI application file. While functional for local development, it's largely superseded by  for Vercel deployment due to structural changes.
    -   **Changes**: Remains mostly as the initial robust backend with CRUD, JST handling, double-booking, and validation. No recent direct modifications for Vercel deployment.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Setup and usage instructions.
    -   **Changes**: Updated with more detailed setup, environment variables, and usage info in Japanese, reflecting the API path changes.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Main HTML entry point for React.
    -   **Changes**: Minor updates for title and script optimization.

<pending_tasks>
- **Vercel Deployment**: The application is still not successfully deployed to Vercel, consistently returning 404/500 errors despite numerous attempts to fix  and API handler configurations.
- **Optional Enhancements**: Weekly view, CSV export functionality, simple authentication, email notifications, mobile-responsive improvements. These were mentioned but not prioritized.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The immediate work revolves entirely around resolving the persistent 404 errors on Vercel deployment. Despite multiple attempts to correct , Python API routing, and  handler configurations, the Vercel deployment continues to fail, resulting in a 404 on the frontend and a 500 error on the  endpoint.

The most recent analysis, guided by ChatGPT Codex logs, identified the primary root cause as the 's Mangum handler export format. The build logs indicated that the Python function was not being correctly recognized or built by Vercel. Previously, the handler was changed from  to  and then to a  function. The latest iteration reverted to  in , which the most recent log analysis (Message 331) now suggests is incorrect, pointing back to  as the solution.

The current state of  (as of Message 328 and confirmed by subsequent manual inspection by the AI) ends with . This particular configuration is causing the Python build process to not initiate correctly on Vercel, leading to the 500 API errors and subsequent 404 for the frontend when it tries to connect to a non-existent backend.

Other fixes recently applied and confirmed in the local environment include:
*   Deletion of the root  and  to prevent Vercel build conflicts.
*   Modification of  to use  instead of  for proper SPA fallback and static file handling.
*   Ensuring environment variables (, , ) are correctly set in Vercel's dashboard.

The current task, as of the last message, is to apply the final recommended fix to the  handler in  and then trigger a new deployment.

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to modify  to change  to  and then prompt the user to Save to GitHub and redeploy on Vercel.
